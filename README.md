# Hey-Honey-Project-on-Scratch.MIT-
First project created on Sctrach.MIT
My scratch project is a short interactive game that involves a bear driving to collect honey. The user will answer 1 yes or no questions first, then click Space to start the game to drive the car to collect as much honey as they can within 30 seconds.
